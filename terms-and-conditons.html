            1.2 If the other party wishes to deviate from the general terms and 
            conditions of Villa d'Or, the other party must submit a proposal to that 
            effect explicitly and in writing to Villa d'Or. Villa d'Or can only accept 
            such a change proposal explicitly and in writing from the other party.

        <p>
            2.1 The quotes, offers, stock lists and price lists made by Villa d'Or are entirely without obligation and therefore not binding on it, unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing. In the event of non-acceptance, express offers or quotations will lapse within 1 month of the date, unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing.

        <p>
            2.3 When the sample is delivered, the sample only applies for determining the average quality and average color. Taking into account that historical or antique building materials such as wood, marble, iron, sandstone, (tiles and tiles), etc. are used, the other party is obliged to accept the normal structure and color of the ordered materials. Deviations in color, structure, cracks or damage specific to the sold and delivered historical materials, and repair work performed or repairs performed can therefore not be a reason for cancellation or dissolution of the agreement or rejection of the delivered goods. Also minor deviations from specified models, weights and other deviations, as a result of which no substantial changes are made to the technical and / or aesthetic implementation of the goods, do not give the other party the right to cancel or to dissolve the agreement or the right to refuse the receipt or payment of the goods. A reasonable tolerance is included for sizes.

Unless expressly agreed otherwise, Villa d'Or reserves all its copyright. The designs, images, drawings and sketches provided with the quotation may not be copied or used in any other way, unless Villa d'Or has given written permission for this.

        <p>
            2.7 If the assignment to Villa d'Or (partly) consists of the interpretation of data provided by the other party, Villa d'Or does not accept any liability with regard to disputes arising from this interpretation.

            12.2 Villa d'Or also has the right to invoke force majeure if the circumstance that prevents (further) fulfillment occurs after Villa d'Or should have fulfilled its obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
            12.3 During the period of force majeure, the delivery and other obligations of Villa d'Or are suspended. If the period in which fulfillment of the obligations by Villa d'Or is not possible due to force majeure, lasts longer than all circumstances taking into account is reasonable, both parties are entitled to terminate the agreement, without there being any obligation to pay compensation.
        </p>
        <p>
            12.4 If at the commencement of the force majeure Villa d'Or has already partially fulfilled its obligations or can only partially meet its obligations, it is entitled to separately invoice the already delivered or the deliverable part and the other party is obliged to pay this invoice as if it concerned a separate contract. However, this does not apply if the already delivered or deliverable part has no independent value whatsoever.
